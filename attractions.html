          <h3>El Nido, Palawan</h3>
          <p>
            El Nido is a municipality that is located on the Palawan island.  It's known for crystal clear waters, coral reefs, white-sand beaches, and more. It's located about 260 miles south-west of Manila, and a vacation at El Nido is extremely affordable at an average of $50(USD) a day per person.

            This river is part of the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park.  You can access the entrance of this cave via a short hike from the town of Sabang.
